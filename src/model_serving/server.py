# server.py

"""
This server script utilizes Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, to set up a REST API for serving predictions 
from the Prithvi model. It's designed to handle POST requests to the "/predict" endpoint, where it expects input data 
in JSON format. This input is intended to be processed and fed into the Prithvi model for generating atmospheric 
analysis predictions.

Key components of the script include:

1. Flask App Initialization: Creates a Flask application instance to manage the web server and routes.

2. Prediction Endpoint ("/predict"): Defines a route that listens for POST requests. This endpoint extracts input data 
from the request, performs necessary preprocessing or validation, and passes the data to the Prithvi model for inference.

3. Prediction Handling: Simulates the process of making predictions with the Prithvi model. This part of the script 
needs to be connected to the actual model's prediction function/method. It's a placeholder demonstrating where and 
how to integrate model inference within the server logic.

4. JSON Response: The prediction results are formatted into a JSON response, making it easy for clients to interpret 
the model's output.

5. Server Execution: Specifies the server's host address and port, enabling the Flask application to run and listen 
for incoming requests. Debug mode is enabled for development purposes, providing detailed error logs and enabling live 
reload of the server upon code changes.

Usage:
- The script is executed as a standalone Python application, starting a web server that can be accessed by clients 
  to submit prediction requests.
- Clients can use tools like curl, Postman, or custom software to send JSON-formatted data to the "/predict" endpoint 
  and receive predictions in response.

Future Enhancements:
- Integrate the actual Prithvi model prediction logic to replace the simulated predictions.
- Implement comprehensive input validation and preprocessing to ensure data compatibility with the model.
- Optimize server settings and deployment strategy for production use, considering security, scalability, and performance.
