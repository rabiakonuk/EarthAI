# pipeline.py

"""
This script defines a DataProcessingPipeline class aimed at processing AIRS dataset
for subsequent analysis and inference using the Prithvi model. The pipeline encapsulates
a sequence of data processing steps including loading, cleaning, transforming, and batching
the data, preparing it for efficient analysis.

The class is structured to provide a flexible framework for handling the AIRS data, 
allowing for customization and extension of the processing steps as needed. Key functionalities 
include:

- load_data: Loads AIRS data from a specified input path. This method is adaptable to different
  data formats and structures of the AIRS dataset.
- clean_data: Implements data cleaning procedures such as handling missing values and outliers,
  crucial for maintaining data quality.
- transform_data: Applies transformations to the data to prepare it for analysis, which may
  include normalization, standardization, and feature extraction.
- prepare_batches: Splits the processed data into batches, ready for analysis or model inference.
  This method can be integrated with intelligent batching mechanisms for optimized processing.
- run_pipeline: Orchestrates the execution of the data processing steps, offering a straightforward
  interface to run the entire pipeline.

Example usage at the end of the script demonstrates initializing the pipeline with a path to
the AIRS data and running the defined processing steps. This script serves as a foundational
template for AIRS data preparation and can be tailored to meet specific project requirements or
integrated with machine learning models for atmospheric analysis.

Future enhancements can include integrating advanced data cleaning techniques, incorporating
more sophisticated data transformation and feature engineering methods, and optimizing the
batching process for parallel processing or distributed computing environments.
