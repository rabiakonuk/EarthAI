scheduler.py

A sophisticated task scheduler script that dynamically prioritizes and executes tasks based on their urgency, resource requirements, and optimal batching strategies. This script is inspired by the ORCA paper's approach to iteration-level scheduling and efficient resource management, making it well-suited for distributed systems with varying computational demands and priorities.

Key Improvements and Features:
- Dynamic Resource Allocation: Manages tasks based on real-time system load and task requirements, using a ThreadPoolExecutor to simulate concurrent task execution.
- Selective Batching: Groups tasks based on similar characteristics (such as priority) before execution, optimizing throughput and resource utilization in a manner consistent with ORCA's selective batching principle.
- Enhanced Error Handling and Logging: Incorporates comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure robustness and facilitate troubleshooting, providing clear visibility into the scheduler's operations.
- Dependency-Aware Scheduling: Introduces the capability to manage task dependencies, ensuring that certain tasks are completed before others begin, which is essential for complex workflows that have interdependent steps.
- Integration with Data Processing and Model Serving: Designed to work seamlessly with data processing pipelines and model serving infrastructure, forming a cohesive end-to-end system that can handle a variety of tasks, from data preparation to predictive analysis.
- Scalability and Deployment: Adapts for scalability and deployment in distributed environments, supporting containerization and orchestration technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes, to meet the demands of a production-grade system.

Note: This script serves as an advanced prototype that demonstrates the core concepts of a dynamic task scheduler. It requires integration with real-world data processing functions and model inference code to be deployed in a production environment.
